The project involves creating a quiz application with core features such as answer selection, score display, and quiz restart functionality. The video demonstrates how to manage user interactions effectivelyâ€”for example, disabling options after a choice is made and updating the button text on the final question. The emphasis is on using fundamental programming concepts like arrays, functions, and DOM manipulation to build the app without AI assistance, encouraging hands-on learning and a solid grasp of the basics.
